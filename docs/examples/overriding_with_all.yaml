# This example showcases the all task, which schedules multiple tasks immediately. This is primarily used when a task
# accepts another task as a parameter, but you want to schedule more than one. We can also nest the all task within a
# sequence task, so that one step of the sequence will not advance until all of that step's nested tasks are complete.
#
# Once the third task below is complete, check the timestamps for the three created files and you will see that
# hello2.txt was created roughly 10 seconds after hello1.txt, and hello3.txt was created roughly 30 seconds after
# hello2.txt
